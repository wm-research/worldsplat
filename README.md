WorldSplat is a **feed-forward 4D scene generation framework** designed for autonomous driving.  
It introduces a **Gaussian-centric representation** that directly produces controllable 4D Gaussians from multi-modal latent diffusion features, enabling **spatially and temporally consistent novel-view driving videos** under user-defined trajectory shifts.

## ðŸš€ Highlights

- **4D-aware Latent Diffusion**  
  Integrates RGB, depth, and motion information to create a unified multi-modal latent space.

- **Feed-forward Gaussian Decoder**  
  Predicts pixel-aligned 3D Gaussians and performs **dynamicâ€“static decomposition** to construct controllable 4D scenes.

- **High-fidelity Novel View Rendering**  
  Generates multi-track driving videos with **improved temporal consistency** via an enhanced diffusion refinement stage.

- **Downstream Benefits**  
  The generated data improves perception tasks such as **3D object detection** and **BEV map segmentation**.

## ðŸ“¦ Code Availability

ðŸš§ **Code is coming soon!**  
We are cleaning up the implementation and will release the full training and inference pipeline shortly.  
Stay tuned and watch this repository for updates.
